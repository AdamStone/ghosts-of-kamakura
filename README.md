###Ghosts of Kamakura

My first web project (2011), a photo gallery site of some of my favorite photos from Japan. This was a personal project used as an exercise in learning HTML and CSS.

At the time I was still intimidated by javascript, so I set out to use only CSS to achieve something like dynamic functionality. Mainly this meant using CSS :hover to display full-size images when mousing over the thumbnails. This is obviously not a good approach since all the full-size images are loaded when the page loads, even though they're not initially visible.
